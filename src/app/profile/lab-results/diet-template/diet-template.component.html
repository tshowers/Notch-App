            <h4>Diet Report Summary</h4>
            <p>The following classifications correspond to the Reaction Class noted on your Food Antibody Assessment
                report. The classification of 0 to IV identifies the level of food-specific-antibodies measured from
                your blood sample via Notch Health’s semi-quantitative ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay) and
                quantitative Chemiluminescent Assay. Not all antibody tests (i.e.: IgA, IgE and IgG) may have been
                ordered by your practitioner.</p>
            <p>These foods are omitted from the 4-day rotation guideline:</p>

            <p>This report does not identify IgE-mediated anaphylaxis risks. Avoid all foods to which you have had an

            <p>Attached is a sample rotation diet guideline based on your personal test results. The concept behind
                rotation-style elimination diets is to encourage nutritional diversification while eliminating the most
                reactive foods and rotating in foods that were lower on the reactivity scale.</p>
            <p>Our rotation diet guideline is designed so that you don’t consume the same food more than once every four
                days and no foods of the same family more than once every two days. The guideline includes all foods
                that received a low score on the reactivity scale. The rotation diet plan alternates the food families
                based on a four-day cycle, ensuring that no food is consumed more than once every four days.</p>
            <p>Please note that this guideline isn’t mandatory – it is only meant to serve as a tool for those looking
                to pursue a rotation-style elimination diet. Notch Health provides this diet guideline for your
                consideration, but your results are best interpreted by a healthcare practitioner who can provide
                personalized guidance and recommend specific dietary changes.</p>
