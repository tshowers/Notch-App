            <h4>What Your Results Mean</h4>
            <p>Vitamin D2 and D3 are metabolized in the liver and kidney to the metabolically active
                1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which acts in the body through specialized vitamin D receptors (VDRs).
                Vitamin D regulates bone metabolism, immune system and inflammatory responses.</p>
            <p>Insufficient levels of vitamin D are associated with poor bone mineralization (rickets in children;
                osteoporosis or osteomalacia in adults). Lower levels of vitamin D have been associated with various
                inflammatory disorders such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, and several autoimmune
                disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythrematosus and multiple sclerosis.
                Insufficient vitamin D levels may also increase the risk of certain types of cancer. Large
                population studies suggest that all-cause mortality is increased if vitamin D levels are < 17.8
                  ng/mL.
                  Medications
                  such
                  as
                  cholestyramine,
                  colestipol,
                  orlistat,
                  or
                  mineral
                  oil
                  can
                  decrease
                  vitamin
                  D
                  absorption.</p>
                    <p>If the results of your vitamin D test indicate a deficiency, talk to your physician about how
                        to increase your levels. Options include eating food high in vitamin D, getting more
                        sunshine, and taking supplements. Food sources of vitamin D include fortified foods (milk,
                        some eggs and cereal (bread) products) and fatty fish such as mackeral, salmon or sardines.
                        The established Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) for vitamin D supplementation is 4,000 IU/day
                        (100 μg/day) for adults.</p>
